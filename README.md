# Owl Books

This repository contains the project files for the Assessment 1 of the COSC2430 - Web Programming course at RMIT University Vietnam. The task was to develop a static website for a fictional bookstore, "Owl Books".

## About The Project

## Features

The website includes the following features:
1. **Home Page:** A welcoming page that introduces the Domino Bookstore.
2. **Book Listing:** Showcases the variety of books available in the bookstore.
3. **Book Details:** Individual pages for each book, detailing its title, author, price, genre, and a brief description.

## Getting Started
