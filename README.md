# Owl Books Website

## Overview
**Owl Books** is a premier online bookstore showcasing a diverse range of books from various genres and sources. Drawing inspiration from the owl, a symbol of wisdom and knowledge in many cultures, our goal is to empower readers on their journey of discovery, learning, and personal growth.

## Purpose
This repository hosts the static prototype of the Owl Books website, intended for review and feedback from senior developers. It provides insights into the website's structure, design aesthetics, and the technical specifics of its HTML and CSS.

## Scope
The project encapsulates:
1. A clear representation of the website's structure through HTML.
2. Aesthetic designs indicating the strategic application of CSS.
3. Ensured responsiveness across various devices.

## Project Description
Based on the provided sketches, we've developed several core features:

- **Homepage:** The initial landing page.
- **Book Listings:** A catalogue of available books.
- **Detailed Book Views:** Individual pages for each book.
- **Contact Page:** A dedicated section for users to reach out.

Additional features:
- Pre-order form for upcoming releases.
- Recommendations for related books.
- Spotlighted videos related to book themes or authors.
- A newsletter sign-up to keep users updated.

### HTML
The backbone of this static website project. Semantic tags, classes, and IDs have been meticulously employed to lay a solid foundation for future iterations.

### CSS
The website uses a single CSS file to maintain consistency and ease of management. This choice also ensures efficient use of HTML classes and IDs.

### Vanilla JavaScript
> **Note:** JavaScript hasn't been implemented in this phase. However, we recognize its potential for enhancing user experience in subsequent updates.
